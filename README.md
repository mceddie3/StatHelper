# StatHelper
Main is where I call my GUI and array.
Array is where I take in an arrayList of integers from the user and I sort that array and make it look nice. 
Every other class extends Array and is different calculations for the user to choose from
GUI has labels, buttons, and a text feild. 
When I am done with this project:
you should be able to enter your dataset into the text feild and hit submit and a message saying "dataset successfuly submitted" should appear.
you should be able to then press a button for what you would like to calculate with you dataset
that button upon being pressed should take you to a result page with the calculations made and printed in a nice format
